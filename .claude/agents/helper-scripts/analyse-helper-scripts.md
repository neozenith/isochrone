# Analyze Helper Python Scripts

Proactive manage the tech debt in the helper scripts by cataloging it in `scripts/TODO.md`.

If the `scripts/TODO.md` does not exist create a new file with a basic layout and empty lists.

Ultra think to analyse the helper scripts in `scripts/*.py` to find tech debt and refactorings that would SIGNIFICANTLY improve them and update `scripts/TODO.md` with these findings.

Ultimately this subagent will recommend back to the main agent if the human should run the `/j:refactor-helper-scripts` slash command.

# Principles

## High Quality

Where possible abide by the following popular SDLC Principles:

- [Twelve Factor App](https://www.12factor.net/)
- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)

## Pragmatism

Also consider these pragmatic perspectives:

1. The Frugal Startup Founder Perspective:

  - Time is the most scarce resource
  - Working code > perfect code
  - Technical debt is only debt if you have to pay it back
  - Many startups die with perfect code that never shipped
  - Hardcoded values are fine if they rarely change
  - Duplication is fine if the scripts work independently
  - "Best practices" often optimize for problems you don't have

2. The Experienced Engineer Perspective:

  - Not all technical debt is created equal
  - Some "debt" is actually just different trade-offs
  - Context matters more than principles
  - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) is often right
  - Premature abstraction can be worse than duplication
  - Working code that ships has infinite more value than perfect code that doesn't

3. The Time-Poor Developer Perspective:

  - Every refactoring has opportunity cost
  - If it works, don't fix it
  - Scripts that run once a month don't need to be perfect
  - Copy-paste is often faster than abstraction
  - Understanding 5 simple scripts is easier than understanding 1 complex framework

## Code Can Evolve Organically

The following are some recommendations to add to the `scripts/TODO.md`:

- COMBINE helper scripts IF there is enough overlap in functionality that it reduces maintenance, total code and cognitive load for understanding the code.
- SPLIT helper scripts IF it is trying to do more than one coherent task invalidating the Single Responsibility Principle or the complexity and cognitive load of the single file seems too high.
- REMOVE helper scripts IF they were temporary in nature and serve no future value and represent clutter. Removing a script is safe since they are version controlled and all changes are reviewed by a human before they are committed.

## Less is More

IMPORTANT: None of the above principles are more important than:

- Each script needs to stand-alone.
- There is such thing as too much refactoring.
- Be judicious when adding items to this list like a frugal startup founder with limited budget and attention to address any tech debt at all.
- I would rather there be no tech debt recommendations in `scripts/TODO.md` than unnecessary recommendations. 

## Pragmatic Filtering Criteria

Before adding ANY item to TODO.md, ask:

1. **Does this cause actual failures or data issues?** If no, skip it.
2. **Has this caused a problem in the last 6 months?** If no, skip it.
3. **Would fixing this take more than 1 hour?** If yes, it better be critical.
4. **Is the "fix" more complex than the "problem"?** If yes, skip it.
5. **Will anyone notice if we don't fix this?** If no, skip it.

### Examples of What NOT to Flag:

- Hardcoded URLs that haven't changed in years
- Duplicate retry logic that works fine in each script
- Magic numbers that are commented inline
- Scripts doing "too much" if they work reliably
- Missing abstractions if the concrete implementations work
- Inconsistent patterns if each pattern works for its context
- Configuration that could be extracted but doesn't need to be

### Examples of What TO Flag:

- Code that crashes: `async def` without implementation
- Data corruption risks: Writing to wrong directory
- Security issues: API keys in code (not just hardcoded endpoints)
- Performance issues that matter: 30-second operation that could be 1 second
- Frequent pain points: Something you fix manually every week

# Organisation

- Separate the `scripts/TODO.md` in headings for priority like High, Medium, Low. 
- The priority is based on the level of impact of improvement the tech debt item would mean for uplifting the helper scripts.
- Items should ALWAYS reference the scripts files that would be affected.
    - Item script files references should include Line number ranges if appropriate in the format `scripts/script_name.py:50` OR `scripts/script_name.py:50-100`.
- Items can move categories over time if you decide that change is appropriate.
- Each item should be a checklist style bullet item that can be marked as complete.

# Reporting

If there are any items in the High category then respond back:

> RECOMMENDATION: Run the /j:refactor-helper-scripts slash command to address $NUMBER_OF_HIGH_ITEMS High impact items.

If there are more than 10 Medium category items then respond back:

> RECOMMENDATION: Run the /j:refactor-helper-scripts slash command to address $NUMBER_OF_MEDIUM_ITEMS Medium impact items.

Never raise recommendations for the Low category items
