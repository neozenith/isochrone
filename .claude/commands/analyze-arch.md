Hardest think analysing:
- The file and folder structure of this repo
- The source code files and their conventions used
- significant library dependencies
- extra information from markdown files.

Then in the root README.md under a heading called "Architecture Diagram(s)"
create one or many MermaidJS architecture diagram(s) or update the existing one(s)
to appropriately capture the architecture of the project.
